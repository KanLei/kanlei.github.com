* Education is not the filling of a pail but the lighting of a fire. -Yeats

* The real point of education is to get you interested in something, to learn something more about the subject matter on your own and not just what you have to digest to get a good grade in some class. As one of our fathers (Remzi’s dad, Vedat Arpaci) used to say, “Learn beyond the classroom”. -Operating Systems: Three Easy Pieces
