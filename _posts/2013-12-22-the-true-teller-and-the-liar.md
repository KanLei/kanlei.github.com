Here we go.A long time ago, a man wanted to go to the heaven. When he've gotten to the destination after walking for a long time. He saw two doors, and besides these two doors, there are two people sitting there. There is an ancient saying, one door leads to heaven, the other door leads to hell. **And one person always tells the truth, the other one always lies. And they also know which door leads to the heaven, and which door leads to the hell. Both of them know each other. But he didn't know who's who.** Now he only has one chance. He also can ask one question of them to decide which door to open.

Question

	What question dose he ask?
	Who does he ask it to?

Answer <font color="white">-> What would the other guy say is the correct door to open? </font>

*Note: copy the "Answer" line, you will see the answer.*
